Item level determines the power of your items.
The higher the item level, the more powerful the item is.

Item levels are further divided into tiers.
At certain (break)points, the affixes that roll on an item move into the next tier,
having the potential to roll higher values.

Nearly every affix in Diablo 4 abides by this breakpoint system, but there are some exceptions.
An item's base DPS or Armor rating scales linearly with Item Power, they don't follow the breakpoint system.
This also applies to HP and Thorn affixes on items.
All other affixes abide by item level breakpoints.

Item level can be increased by upgrading an item at the blacksmith.
It can be useful to do so in order to get to the next breakpoint of an item you like.
Note that while the range in which an affix can roll increases, ***it rerolls the value***, which may lead to a worse roll than it was before.
Make sure to always *preview the upgrade* before upgrading it.
